## Add Twitter Threads From Cards

You can import Twitter threads into your spaces by clicking the `+ Thread` button inside any card with a tweet URL.

A really helpful way to build knowledge by literally moving ideas around and connecting them to your own thoughts

Next, create new spaces by replying to tweets with:

`@kinopioClub save`

After a couple seconds you'll be notified on Twitter that your new tweet space has been created for you to edit in Kinopio
