Live Spaces shows public spaces that are currently being edited. It's a fun way to discover new spaces and community creators.

Space appear in Live when both:

- the space privacy is either public or open
- a member of the space (if public), or any signed in user (if open), paints or edits cards in the space

Spaces get removed from Live when either:

- the live user moves to another space
- the privacy of the space is changed to private
- the last received editing event for the space is over an hour old
