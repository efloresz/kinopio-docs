Hi, my name is Pirijan and I created Kinopio to help people and teams create new ideas and understand why they think the way they do.

Before Kinopio, I was the co-creator of Glitch.com, where I designed and built its original user interfaces. I believe in software that's designed by artists, and built by craftspeople.

You can read my blog, where I write more about building Kinopio, at [pketh.org](http://pketh.org), or follow me on Twitter [@pketh](http://twitter.com/pketh)

I hope you enjoy using Kinopio and find it useful,

xoxo
